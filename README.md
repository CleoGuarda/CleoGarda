## 🧩 Features
### 🧰 Core Protection Modules

CleoGuarda’s defense is built upon four key modules — each engineered to intercept, alert, and protect across the most vulnerable stages of token interaction:

🧠 **GuardEye**  
Scans smart contracts before interaction.  
Flags high-risk traits such as:
- Unlocked or missing LP
- Developer-controlled wallets
- Transfer restrictions and blacklisting functions  
*→ Know the threat before you touch the token.*

⚠️ **RiskDefender**  
Analyzes live blockchain transactions to catch:  
- Suspicious wallet movement patterns  
- Clusters of connected wallets (Sybil behavior)  
- Sudden shifts in liquidity  
*→ Real-time behavioral firewall against market manipulation.*

🍯 **CryptoSafe**  
Detects token traps instantly, including:  
- Honeypot mechanisms (tokens you can’t sell)  
- Extreme sell tax setups  
- Burn loops or fake LP injections  
*→ Avoid the bait before it's too late.*

🔍 **ShieldWatch**  
Post-launch surveillance that never sleeps.  
Monitors tokens for:
- Unexpected LP unlocks  
- Aggressive developer withdrawals  
- Behavior typical of rugpull timing  
*→ Continuous watchtower on every asset you've scanned.*

## 🧑‍💻 Code Access

CleoGuarda’s intelligence is powered by modular AI logic designed to assess risks at every stage — from contract interaction to post-launch token behavior. Below are the core AI-driven engines that bring Cleo’s defenses to life.

### 🧠 GuardEye — Contract Risk Scanner

**Goal:**  
Detect malicious or suspicious contract traits *before* any interaction occurs.

**How it works:**  
Analyzes key contract properties:
- LP status (locked/unlocked)
- Contract age (in days)
- Number of developer wallets
- Presence of transfer restrictions

```javascript
function guardEye(token) {
  let score = 0;

  if (!token.lpLocked) score += 40;
  if (token.contractAge < 5) score += 25;
  if (token.devWallets > 3) score += 20;
  if (token.transferLimits) score += 15;

  return score >= 60
    ? "⚠️ High Risk"
    : score >= 30
    ? "⚠️ Medium Risk"
    : "✅ Low Risk";
}
```

###⚠️ RiskDefender — Transaction Behavior Scoring
Goal:
Evaluate on-chain behavior in real time to detect manipulation and coordinated bot activity.

#### How it works:
Scans live transactions for:

- High transaction frequency

- Limited wallet diversity

- Wallet clustering

```javascript
function riskDefender(txFrequency, uniqueWallets, clusterScore) {
  if (txFrequency > 100 && uniqueWallets < 20 && clusterScore > 0.7) {
    return "🚨 High Threat Detected";
  } else if (clusterScore > 0.4) {
    return "⚠️ Moderate Threat";
  } else {
    return "✅ Normal Activity";
  }
}
```
#### Interpretation:
A high number of repetitive transactions between few wallets suggests botnets or market manipulation.

###🍯 CryptoSafe — Honeypot & Exit Trap Detection
#### Goal:Detect whether a token is unsellable or hiding exit traps.
#### How it works- Checks:
-  If the token can be sold
-  Sell tax percentage
-  Fake liquidity signals

```python
def honeypot_status(can_sell, sell_tax):
    if not can_sell:
        return "🚫 Honeypot Detected"
    elif sell_tax > 50:
        return "⚠️ Suspicious Token"
    else:
        return "✅ Sellable"
```
#### Interpretation: 
Tokens with blocked selling or extremely high tax are flagged to prevent exit scams.

### 🔍 ShieldWatch — Ongoing Threat Monitoring
#### Goal:Provide post-launch monitoring to catch rugpulls and stealth exits.

#### How it works - Tracks:
- Volume spikes
- LP status changes
- Developer wallet transactions

```python
function shieldWatch(lpStatus, devTxs, volumeChange) {
  if (!lpStatus && devTxs > 5 && volumeChange > 200) {
    return "🚨 Rugpull Warning";
  } else if (!lpStatus) {
    return "⚠️ Unlocked LP Detected";
  } else {
    return "✅ Stable for now";
  }
}
```
#### Interpretation: Even “safe-looking” tokens can turn malicious after launch. ShieldWatch catches delayed threats.
